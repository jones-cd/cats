This is the coding test submission by Chris Jones for the position of Junior Developer at Felinesoft.

MY SOLUTION
Uses JavaScript.
It connects to the API and creates a card for each of the breeds, detailing a description and country of origin on each.

FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS
I would seek to include an image on each card and a 'select' dropdown menu so that only one card is displayed at a time.

Thanks for your time.
